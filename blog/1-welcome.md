## Why I Made Breeze.js

Frontend development today can be overwhelming. From React to Vue to Svelte, frameworks are everywhereâ€”and so are the opinions, bundlers, boilerplates, and breaking changes.

**Breeze.js takes a different approach.** It asks:

> What if building dynamic UIs didn't require a full framework?

Breeze.js is a micro-library designed around minimalism, flexibility, and control. It gives you the essentials for creating reactive interfacesâ€”without giving up the native web platform or pulling in thousands of lines of code.

It's not a framework. It's a **toolbox**.

## Our Philosophy

### 1. **Stay Close to the DOM**

Instead of abstracting HTML and JavaScript away, Breeze.js leans into them. Its utilities are thin wrappers around real browser APIs that reduce repetitive code without obscuring whatâ€™s happening under the hood.

### 2. **Only What You Need**

No virtual DOM. No component lifecycle spaghetti. Just reactive state, DOM helpers, and optional form management. Use as little or as much as you like.

### 3. **Zero Dependencies**

You can read the source in minutes. Breeze.js is dependency-free and lightweight, so itâ€™s perfect for learning, rapid prototyping, and embedding into small projects.

### 4. **Build**

Breeze.js works well with other tools. Use it alongside Alpine.js, HTMX, or even React if you want to. It doesnâ€™t take over, it just helps out.

## What Comes with Breeze.js

* `newElement()` â€“ Clean, safe element creation
* `State` â€“ Tiny reactive container with DOM bindings
* `Form` â€“ Programmatic form creation
* `Layer` â€“ DOM layering with z-index management
* `h()` â€“ Declarative DOM builder with optional event binding

## Getting Started: A Simple Counter

Hereâ€™s a quick example of what building with Breeze.js feels like:

```js
import { createState, newElement } from './breeze.js';
import { h } from './h.js';

const state = createState({ count: 0 });

const app = document.getElementById('app');

const display = newElement('p');
state.bind(display, 'textContent', 'count');

h(app, 'button', {}, 'Increment', 'click', () => {
  state.setState({ count: state.getState().count + 1 });
});

app.appendChild(display);
```

ðŸ’¡ Thatâ€™s it. No build tools. No configs. Just HTML, JS, and Breeze.

## Final Thoughts

If you're tired of fighting complexity and want to enjoy building interfaces again, give Breeze.js a try.
